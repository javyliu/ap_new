  <h3>Actions</h3>

  <div class="mt-2">
    Jav actions allow you to perform specific tasks on one or more of your records. For example, you might want to mark a user as inactive and optionally send a message that may be customized by the person that wants to run the action.

    <div class="mt-2">
      <code class="text-lg">Toggle published</code>
      <div class="mt-1">
        <code class="p-1 rounded-sm bg-sky-500 text-white">bin/rails generate jav:action toggle_published</code>
